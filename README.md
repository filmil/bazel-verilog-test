# bazel-verilog-test

Testing verilog build rules from https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl

At the time of this writing, following instructions at https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl#usage
results in errors, as reported at: https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl/issues/123

This repo and the rules fork at https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl/ are an attempt to fix that bug.
